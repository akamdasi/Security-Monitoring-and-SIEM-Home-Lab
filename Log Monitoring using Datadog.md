   ```
2. Install the Datadog Agent:
```
DD_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script.sh)"
```
Replace <YOUR_API_KEY> with the API key copied earlier.
3. Enable log collection:
- Edit the agent configuration file:
```
sudo nano /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml
```
- Add or update the following lines:
```
logs_enabled: true
```
- Save and close the file.
4. Configure log sources:

```
- Add the following configuration:
```
logs:
  - type: file
    path: /var/log/syslog
    service: ubuntu
    source: syslog
```
- Save and close the file.
5. Restart the Datadog Agent:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent
