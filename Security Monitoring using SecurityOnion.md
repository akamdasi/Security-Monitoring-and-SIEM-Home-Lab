### Part 1: Setting Up Security Onion
**Objective**: Install and configure Security Onion to act as the central log and event monitoring platform.

#### Step 1: Install Security Onion
1. Download the Security Onion ISO.
2. Create a new virtual machine in your virtualization platform:
   - Assign at least 8 CPU cores, 16 GB RAM, and 100 GB disk space.
   - Mount the Security Onion ISO and boot from it.
3. Follow the installation steps:
   - Choose **Evaluation Mode** for simplicity.
   - Configure the hostname and assign a static IP.
   - Complete the installation and restart the VM.
4. After reboot, the system will display a URL for the Security Onion web interface.

#### Step 2: Access the Security Onion Web Interface
1. Open a browser and navigate to the URL provided during the installation.
2. Log in using the admin credentials created during setup.

### Part 2: Setting Up Ubuntu Server to Collect Syslog
**Objective**: Configure the Ubuntu server to forward syslog to Security Onion.

#### Step 1: Install and Configure Rsyslog
1. Log in to the Ubuntu server.
2. Update the system:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  ``
3. Install rsyslog:
```
sudo apt install rsyslog -y
```
4. Configure rsyslog to forward logs to Security Onion:
```
sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/50-securityonion.conf
```
- Add the following:
```
*.* @<Security-Onion-IP>:514
```
5. Restart the rsyslog service:
```
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
```
#### Step 2: Verify Logs in Security Onion
1. In the Security Onion web interface, navigate to Kibana.
2. Search for logs from the Ubuntu server using its hostname or IP address.

### Part 3: Setting Up Windows to Collect Events
Objective: Configure a Windows machine to forward event logs to Security Onion.

#### Step 1: Download and Install Winlogbeat
1. Download Winlogbeat on the Windows machine.
2. Extract the Winlogbeat package and navigate to the extracted folder.
#### Step 2: Configure Winlogbeat
1. Open winlogbeat.yml in a text editor.
2. Configure the output to forward logs to Security Onion:
```
output:
  logstash:
    hosts: ["<Security-Onion-IP>:5044"]
```
3. Define the event logs to collect:
```
winlogbeat.event_logs:
  - name: Application
  - name: Security
  - name: System
```
#### Step 3: Install and Start Winlogbeat
1. Install Winlogbeat as a service:
```
.\install-service-winlogbeat.ps1
```
2. Start the service:
```
Start-Service winlogbeat
```
#### Step 4: Verify Logs in Security Onion
1. In the Security Onion web interface, navigate to Kibana.
2. Search for logs from the Windows machine using its hostname or IP address.
